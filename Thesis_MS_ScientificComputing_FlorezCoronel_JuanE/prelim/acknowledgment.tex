I want to express my deepest gratitude to my wonderful wife, Nichool; your patience, understanding, and countless sacrifices made it possible for me to focus on my research. Your faith in my abilities has been my rock. To my family, Edwin, Angy, and Salomé, for their unwavering support, love, and encouragement throughout this academic journey. Your belief in me has been my constant source of motivation. I am also profoundly grateful to my esteemed professor, Dr. Almodóvar, for his mentorship, guidance, and expertise. Your insights and dedication to my academic growth have been invaluable.

This thesis is a culmination of not just my efforts but the collective support and faith of my loved ones. I am thankful beyond words for your presence in my life.
